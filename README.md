	The intent of the project is to create a single page web site(SPW). It should contain below anchor tags. 

* Home
* About Us
* Products & Catalog
* Gallery 
* Contact Us

-- Home: Should bring back the control to the main page. 

-- About Us: Should provide information about the 'United Co' company. 

-- Products & Catalog: Should detail about the products and host of other capabilities of the company.

-- Gallery: For now, let's try to have 5-6 images. 

-- Contact Us: Should have the company contact info (Email/Mob/etc)

Task List: 

* The entire website should contain a background image. Refer to the best SPW in web. 
* For the above 5 sections, lets try to create content of atleast 3-5 lines. 
* Create a header section which will contain these 5 links. 
	- Header section will contain the company name and banner to the left. To the right all the 5 links. 
* Create a footer section (at the bottom) which will contain copyright information.
* In between this, we will have rest of the sections. 
* From the header section, if user clicks on any of the links it should go to the respective section in the same page.


From the task list, feel free to pick what you want to work on. Let's catch up next week for review. Meanwhile
